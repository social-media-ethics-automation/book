We've looked at some examples of trolling, but now let's try one ourselves.

We are going to build a bot that replies to people who mention us. But we will then see how we can troll bot we made and make it say something offensive.

Before we make this bot though, we need to learn how to use conditionals in Python, and some additional ways of working with strings.
