You may also want the fake_api files here: [https://github.com/social-media-ethics-automation/book/tree/main/docs/reddit/_sources/fake_apis/](https://github.com/social-media-ethics-automation/book/tree/main/docs/reddit/_sources/fake_apis/)


Additionally, we assume you (or your students) will have a separate key files (e.g., `reddit_keys.py`, `discord_keys.py`, etc.).
