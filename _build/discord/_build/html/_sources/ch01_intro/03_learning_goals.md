# Learning Goals

As you go through this book on social media, ethics, and automation, our goal is for you to learn and practice a set of skills (_analysis, connections, research, and programming_) to develop as an informed human (_a social media user, a member of a society, and a potential tech worker_).

## Skill Goals

The skills we want you to learn and practice in this book are:

- Analysis (Reading comprehension, media literacy)
- Make connections:
  - (recognize patterns, make personal connections, history,  apply ethics frameworks)
- Independent Research
  - Doing your own research, fact checking
- Programming


## Informed Human Goals

Our goals for you to become an informed human are:

As a **social media user**, we hope you learn how social media sites influence you, from how your data gets used or abused, to how harassment and spam bots operate, to how platforms manipulate your emotions and mental state. We hope you could then be a more knowledgeable consumer and participant on social media sites.

As a **member of a society** that is influenced by social media, we hope you learn about the societal impact of automated social media systems, and how those systems are designed under different economic, social, and governmental pressures. We hope you could then be more knowledgeable in what you might advocate for or vote for in how social media sites operate.

As a **potential tech worker** that might work for a social media site, we hope you learn how to analyze the ethical tradeoffs made in designing automated systems. We hope you could then bring those concerns into how you design and implement automated systems for social media sites.
