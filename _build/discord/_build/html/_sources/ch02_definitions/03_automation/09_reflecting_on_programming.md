# Reflections on the Reddit Bot

- When one of us ran the program, who made those reddit posts (me? you? the bot?)?
- Notice that there are at least three times of actions for posting reddit post with this bot, one is when the code was originally written, another is when the code was modified, and and the other is when the code is run. These could even be done by different people.
  - How do you divide out responsibility for a bots actions between the person writing the code and the person running the program?
