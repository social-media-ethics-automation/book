# # Practice: Conditionals and String Manipulation

# ## IF ELSE Statements
# Look at the following code example and try running it

# In[1]:


x = 5

if x < 11:
    print('A')
elif x >= 13:
    print('B')
else:
    print('C')


# Now what would happen if x was changed to 30? What would the output be?

# What value would the `x` variable have to be in order to get the output 'C'?

# ## String Manipulation
# 
# Now, make a variable with your name in it, called `my_name`

# In[2]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# Write code to display the first letter of your name

# In[3]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# Write code to display the last letter of your name

# In[4]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# ## Ifs with Strings
# Save a string in a variable called `message` and have it end with either a question mark `?`, an exclamation mark `!`, or a period `.`

# In[5]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# Now, make a set of if/elif/else statements which will display either:
# - `The message was a question`
# - `The message was an exclamation`
# - `The message was a statement`
# - `The message ended unexpectedly`
# 
# depending on what character the message ended in a `?`, `!`, `.`, or something else. Hint: use the `endswith` function.

# TODO: enter your code here


# Now, go back and modify the message string to see if the different if/elif/else options all work
