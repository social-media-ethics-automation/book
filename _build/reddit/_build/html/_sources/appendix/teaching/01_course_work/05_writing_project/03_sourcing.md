# Sourcing Topic/Scenario

Now that you have a proposal, you need to find sources on the topic/scenario that you will be analyzing. Even if you are talking about an event that happened to you, you will need to find additional sources to put what happened in a larger context.

You will need to list at least 4 sources and make an annotated bibliography.

- You will need to have at least two sources that are journalistic or academic
  - Meaning they go through a journalistic or academics standards process, not wikipedia, or the class textbook, or a random person posting a blog or a social media post
  - For example: a book, or a journalistic source like npr, the Washington Post, wired.com, Vice Magazine's Motherboard section, polygon.com, etc.

For each source do the following:

- Write a citation for the source
  - You can use any standard citation format such as APA or MLA
  - You can google something like "citation generator" to find websites that will help you format your citation
- Write a paragraph of why you are using this source and what you are planning on using from it
