# Examples of Bots (or apps)
There are many types of bots in the social media world. Here are some examples of different bots:

## Friendly bots:
Some bots are intended to be helpful, using automation to make tasks easier for others or to provide information, such as:
- Auto caption: [https://twitter.com/headlinerclip](https://twitter.com/headlinerclip)
- Vaccine progress: [https://twitter.com/vax_progress](https://twitter.com/vax_progress)
- Blocking groups of people: [https://twitter.com/blockpartyapp_](https://twitter.com/blockpartyapp_)
- Social Media managing programs that help people schedule and coordinate posts
- Delete old tweets: [https://tweetdelete.net/](https://tweetdelete.net/)
- See a new photo of a red panda every hour: [https://twitter.com/RedPandaEveryHr](https://twitter.com/RedPandaEveryHr)


Bots might have significant limits on how helpful they are, such as tech support bots you might have had frustrating experiences with on various websites.


## Malicious bots:
On the other hand, some bots are created with the intentions of harming or deceiving others. For example, people use bots to spam advertizments, or harass others. You can use bots as a way of [buying fake followiers](https://www.socialwick.com/tiktok/followers), or making fake crowds that appear to support a cause (called [Astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)).

As one example, in 2016, Rian Johnson, who was in the middle of directing Star Wars: The Last Jedi, got bombarded by tweets that all originated in Russia (likely making at least some use of bots).
>   "I've gotten a rush of tweets -- coordinated tweets. Like, somewhere else on the internet there's like a group on the internet saying, 'Okay, everyone tweet Rian Johnson.' All from Russian accounts, and all begging me not to kill Admiral Hux in this movie."

After the Star Wars: Last Jedi was released, there was a significant online backlash. When a researcher looked into it:
> [Morten] Bay found that 50.9% of people tweeting negatively about “The Last Jedi” were “politically motivated or not even human,” with a number of these users appearing to be Russian trolls. The overall backlash against the film wasn’t even that great, with only 21.9% of tweets analyzed about the movie being negative in the first place.

## Corrupted bots
As a final example, we wanted to tell you about Microsoft Tay a bot that got corrupted.

In 2016, Microsft launched a twitter bot that was intended to learn to speak from other twitter users and have conversations. Twitter users quickly started tweeting racist comments at Tay, which Tay learned from and started tweeting out within one day.

## Fake Bots
We also would like to point out that there are fake bots as well, that is real people pretending their work is the result of a Bot. For example, TikTok user Curt Skelton posted a video claiming that he was actually an AI generated / deepfake character:

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@curt.skelton/video/7135836562771758382" data-video-id="7135836562771758382" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@curt.skelton" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@curt.skelton?refer=embed">@curt.skelton</a> <p></p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ Mr. Roboto - Live - Styx" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Mr-Roboto-Live-7006146083274295298?refer=embed">♬ Mr. Roboto - Live - Styx</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>

But Kurt Skelton was an actual human (in spite of the well done video claiming he was fake). He was just trolling his audience. [Professor Casey Fiesler](https://caseyfiesler.com/) talked about it on her TikTok channel:

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@professorcasey/video/7136618141198667054" data-video-id="7136618141198667054" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@professorcasey" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@professorcasey?refer=embed">@professorcasey</a> <a title="stitch" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stitch?refer=embed">#stitch</a> with @curt.skelton some thoughts on our perceptions of <a title="artificialintelligence" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/artificialintelligence?refer=embed">#artificialintelligence</a> capabilities 🤖 <a title="aiethics" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/aiethics?refer=embed">#aiethics</a> <a title="dalle" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dalle?refer=embed">#dalle</a> <a title="openai" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/openai?refer=embed">#openai</a> <a title="curtskelton" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/curtskelton?refer=embed">#curtskelton</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ Mr. Roboto - Live - Styx" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Mr-Roboto-Live-7006146083274295298?refer=embed">♬ Mr. Roboto - Live - Styx</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
