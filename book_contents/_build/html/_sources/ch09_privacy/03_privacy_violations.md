# Additional Privacy Violations

Besides hacking, there are other forms of privacy violations, such as:

- __Unclear Privacy Rules__: Sometimes privacy rules aren't made clear to the people using a system. For example, if you send "private" messages on a work system, your [boss might be able to read them](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210813-are-your-work-messages-as-private-as-you-think).
- __Deanonymizing Data__: Sometimes companies or researchers release datasets that have been "anonymized," meaning that things like names have been removed, so you can't tell who the data is about. But sometimes people can still deduce who the anonymized data is about. This happened when Netflix released anonymized movie ratings data sets, but [at least some users' data could be traced back to them](https://www.wired.com/2007/12/why-anonymous-data-sometimes-isnt/).
- __Inferred Data__: Sometimes information that doesn't directly exist can be inferred through data mining (as we saw last chapter), and the creation of that new information could be a privacy violation.
  - This includes creation of __[Shadow Profiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_profile)__, which are information about the user that the user didn't provide or consent to
- __Non-User Information__: Social Media sites might collect information about people who don't have accounts, like how [Facebook does](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-tracking/facebook-fuels-broad-privacy-debate-by-tracking-non-users-idUSKBN1HM0DR)
