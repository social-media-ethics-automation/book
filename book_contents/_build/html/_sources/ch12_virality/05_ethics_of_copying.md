# Ethics of copying

## Remixing

Much of the internet has developed a culture of copying and modifying other content, and not necessarily giving attribution to where it came from.

For example, let's look at this meme about stealing memes:

```{figure} steal_meme_4.jpg
---
width: 400px
name: steal_meme_4_fig
alt: "A image of Keanu Reeves as Jesus with laughing emoji. Above it is text that says: \"Me, blessing your meme with a \"HaHa\" before I steal it.\""
---
A meme about stealing memes. (It is unclear how we should cite this)
```

The meme above is composed of many pieces copied from elsewhere, and modified and put together. Here are the pieces we could identify:
  - A painting: [SACRED HEART OF JESUS by Dona Gelsinger](https://www.glowdecor.com/products/sacred-heart-of-jesus-canvas-wall-art) (which itself is copying the form of many paintings before of the [sacred heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart))
  - The background was switched out to make a yellow disk [halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(religious_iconography)) behind the head of Jesus
  - Jesus face is replaces with Keanu Reeves' bearded face (perhaps from the [spongebob movie](https://youtu.be/CJJYewh4Nco?t=57))
  - A laughing [emoticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons#Western) is placed in Jesus' hand.
  - A watermark from @AllMemes appears on Jesus' shoulder.
  - The text about stealing memes added at the top

Communities based on this type of remixing have existed outside the Internet before showing up in social media platforms, such as [sampling in hip hop music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)#Hip_hop) in the 1980s.

In an anthropological introduction to YouTube (from 2008), [Michael Wesch observes this phenomenon]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPAO-lZ4_hU):
> And this is something really quite profound that's happening. Where we can remix this culture that's being thrown at us, where we can take it, re-appropriate it and throw it back. [...] Most of what we do is actually illegal, any remixing is basically illegal. And I could talk more about the- the parameters of that, we have fair use laws that should protect it but the simple fact of ripping a DVD is actually illegal which makes virtually everything we do illegal.


## Cultural appropriation
The online community activity of copying and remixing can be a means of __[cultural appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation)__, which is when one cultural group adopts something from another culture in an unfair or disrespectful way (as opposed to a fair, respectful __[cultural exchange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ45VpBB0rQ)__). For example, [many phrases from Black American culture have been appropriated by white Americans](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sydneethompson/aave-language-appropriation) and had their meanings changed or altered (like "woke", "cancel", "shade", "sip/spill the tea", etc.).

Additionally, White Americans' use of images and gifs of Black people reacting and expressing emotions [has been compared](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/digital-blackface-reaction-gifs) to earlier (and racist) art forms of [blackface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface), where White actors would paint their faces black and then act in exaggerated unintelligent ways.


## Citation and giving credit

So given the community activities on social media of copying, remixing, cultural appropriate, and cultural exchange:
- How do you think attribution should work when copying and reusing content on social media?
  - When is it ok to not cite sources for content?
  - When should sources be cited, and how should they be cited?
- How can you participate in cultural exchange without harmful cultural appropriation?

% 'Tandoh’s inviting generosity also extends to how she showcases the cooks and kitchens that have made her the cook she is, too. Citation in cookbook publishing has long been a thorny issue (ask James Beard); today, the internet, Instagram, and TikTok have deepened the mythic import of the recipe creator, turning attribution into a parasocial pursuit more than a sociocultural one. Who made the recipe is more important than where it came from.

% 'Tandoh pushes back on this by referring to inspirations in headnotes, providing reading lists for each chapter, and noting when recipes belong to other published authors, like Rukmini Iyer of the bestselling Roasting Tin series. Even the easy-read version — which visualizes every single step and item required for 10 simple recipes through photography — suggests other charity cookbooks to try if this one doesn’t work for the cook using it. (Publisher Serpent’s Tail, with whom Tandoh also worked on Eat Up!, has distributed this version of the book to community centers and kitchens across the U.K.)'
