# The Experience of Going Viral
While many people on social media post in hopes of getting attention and even going viral, those who have actually had their content go viral often have mixed feelings about it. For example, author Roxane Gay has said, “[Content going viral is overwhelming, intimidating, exciting, and downright scary.](https://psmag.com/economics/going-viral-is-like-doing-cartwheels-on-the-water-spout-of-a-giant-whale).”

The Washington Post wrote a series of articles on the experience of going viral, first [On TikTok, instant fame often comes with a price: Sleepless nights, shadowbans and viral cruelty](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/tiktok-viral-fame-harassment/), and then [Sorry you went viral. TikTok’s explosive stardom has created a new kind of celebrity. But nothing goes viral like rage.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/tiktok-viral-fame-harassment/). Researcher Dr. Casey Fiesler was interviewed for these articles and talks more about it in this TikTok video:

% Dead link?? [Accidentally famous: The psychology of going viral](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/16/health/social-media-fame/index.html)

% Viral can make people the symbols of different causes (good or bad), or the center of larger arguments. Going viral brings extra scrutiny. Randomness of who goes viral and gets singled out. Ethics about equality like maybe Native American Ethics?
