# Activity: Value statements in what goes viral

## Choose three scenarios

When content goes viral there may be many people with a stake in it's going viral, such as:
- The person (or people) whose content or actions are going viral, who might want attention, or get financial gain, or might be embarrassed or might get criticism or harassment, etc. Different people involved might have different interests. Some may not have awareness of it happening at all (like a video of an infant).
- Different audiences might have interests such as curiosity, or desire to bring justice to a situation, or desire to get attention for themselves or their ideas based on engaging the viral content, or desire to troll or harass others.
- Social networking platforms might have interests such as increases attention to their platform, or increased advertizing, or increased or decreased reputation (in views of different audiences).

List at least three different scenarios of content going viral and list out the interests of different groups and people in the content going viral.

## Create value statements
Social media platforms have some ability to influence what goes viral and how (e.g., recommendation algorithms, what actions are available, what data is displayed, etc.), though they don't have complete control. Still, we can think of what goals you might want them to have as their decisions shape what goes viral online.

Create a set of values statements for when and how you think ideally you would want content to go viral (try to get at least 10). We encourage you to consider different ethics frameworks for ideas.
