# Ethics in Tech

In the first chapter of our book we quoted actor Kumail Nanjiani on tech innovators' lack of consideration of ethical implications of their work. 

Of course, concerns about the implications of technological advancement are nothing new.

And inventors ignoring the ethical consequences of their creations is nothing new as well, and gets critiqued regularly:

A major theme of the movie [Jurassic Park (1993)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/) is scientists not thinking through the implications of their creations.

Many people like to believe (or at least convince others) that they are doing something to make the world a better place, as in this parody clip from the [Silicon Valley show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/) (the one Kumail Nanjiani was on, though not in this clip):

But even people who thought they were doing something good regretted the consequences of their creations, such as [Eli Whitney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Whitney) who hoped his invention of the cotton gin would reduce slavery in the United States, but only made it worse, or [Albert Einstein regretting his role in convincing the US government to invent nuclear weapons](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace-and-war/the-manhattan-project#:~:text=He%20came%20to%20regret%20taking,I%20would%20have%20done%20nothing.%22).
