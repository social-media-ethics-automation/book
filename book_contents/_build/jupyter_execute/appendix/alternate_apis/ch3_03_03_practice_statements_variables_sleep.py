# # Practice: Statements and Variables

# This Python Notebook is a chance for you to try out the programming concepts we have covered thus far.
# 
# As we mentioned previously in the first bot demo (2.3.8), in order to run the code, you can look for the rocket button at the top which will give you an option to "launch binder"
# 
# ![screenshot of this page in the online textbook, with the launch binder link highlighted under the rocket button at the top.](binder_link.png)
# 
# If you launch binder, it will take a while to load, but eventually show you a version of this page Jupyter Notebook in a code editor called Jupyter Lab
# 
# ![a screenshot of this page viewed in jupyter_lab, with menus and options above the editable page](jupyter_lab.png)
# 
# In Jupyter Lab you can double click any section to edit it, and you can press the triangle "run" button to run the code (or display the text).
# 
# ![a screenshot of this page viewed in jupyter_lab,with the triangle "run" button circled. Next to it are a square "interrupt the kernal" button and other options](jupyter_run_code.png)
# 
# When the code runs, the little number to the left of the code block should change. There might also be some output from your action displyed below the code block.
# 
# So now you can go through the rest of this page and try out the practice exercises for yourself!
# 

# ## Variables
# You will first practice saving values into variables. Remember, the way we save a value into a variable is like this:
# ```
# variable_name = value
# ```
# 
# First, save the piece of text "I am writing a computer program!" into a variable called `my_progress`

# In[1]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# ### Viewing variables in the debugger
# Before we continue, we are going to show you how to open the debugger so you can see what is being saved in your variables.
# 
# On the tp right of this tab, press the small bug icon to "enable debugging":
# 
# ![screenshot of this tab in jupyterhub, with the "enable debugging" icon circled at the top right (after the "git" option and before the "Python 3 (ipykernel)" option)](debugging_icon.png)
# 
# Then, if you did the step above correctly, you should see the variable `my_progress` with the value "I am writing a computer program!" next to it:
# 
# ![screenshot of this tab in jupyterhub, with the debugger tab opened on the right. The top section of that tab is variables, which has "special variables" then "function variables" then "my_progress:I am writing a computer program"](debugger_vars.png)

# ### Practice number variables
# First, write and run a line of code to save the value 5 into a variable named `number_of_pies`

# In[2]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# Now, save the value 12.5 into a variable named `cost_per_pie`

# In[3]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# Now make a new variable called `total_pie_cost` and save into the value of the number_of_pies multiplied by the cost_per_pie.
# 
# Note: In python (and many programming languages), the symbol for multiply is `*`

# In[4]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# Now use the `display` function to display what is saved in total_pie_cost

# In[5]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# ### More variable practice
# 
# Now, make a new variable called `first_name` and assign your first name to it

# In[6]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# Now, make a variable calles `last_name` and save your last name to it

# In[7]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# Create a variable called `age` and assign your age to it.

# In[8]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# ~ A year goes by ~
# 
# Increase the `age` variable by 1. 

# In[9]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# Now write three lines of code, with each line using `display` to show what is saved in `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age 

# In[10]:

# ## Sleep
# In order to use sleep, we must first import it from the time library

# In[11]:


from time import sleep


# Now try displaying 5 messages of your choosing, with some pauses between each one:

# In[12]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# ## Twitter Bot Practice
# Now lets try a twitter bot with variables and sleep!
# 
# ### Load Tweepy Library
# First, we need to load the tweepy library

# In[13]:


# Load some code called "tweepy" that will help us work with twitter
import tweepy


# ### (Optional) Make a fake twitter connection with the fake_tweepy library
# For testing purposes, we've added this line of code, which loads a fake version of tweepy, so it wont actually connect to twitter. __If you want to try to actually connect to twitter, don't run this line of code.__%run ../../fake_tweepy/fake_tweepy.ipynb

# In[14]:


get_ipython().run_line_magic('run', '../../fake_tweepy/fake_tweepy.ipynb')


# ### Load your developer access passwords
# To use this on your real twitter account, copy your [developer access passwords](../../prefaces/making_twitter_account.md) into the code below, replacing our fake passwords.

# In[15]:


# Load all your developer access passwords into Python
# TODO: Put your twitter account's special developer access passwords below:
bearer_token = "n4tossfgsafs_fake_bearer_token_isa53#$%$"
consumer_key = "sa@#4@fdfdsa_fake_consumer_key_$%DSG#%DG"
consumer_secret = "45adf$T$A_fake_consumer_secret_JESdsg"
access_token = "56sd5Ss4tsea_fake_access_token_%YE%hDsdr"
access_token_secret = "j^$dr_fake_consumer_key_^A5s#DR5s"


# ### Give tweepy (or fake_tweepy) your developer access passwords

# In[16]:


# Give the tweepy code your developer access passwords so
# it can perform twitter actions
client = tweepy.Client(
   bearer_token=bearer_token,
   consumer_key=consumer_key, consumer_secret=consumer_secret,
   access_token=access_token, access_token_secret=access_token_secret
)


# ### Post a tweet
# Post something you learned in the class so far:
# 
# Remember, the code to post a tweet looks like this: `client.create_tweet(text="This is the tweet text")`

# In[17]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# ### Post from a variable
# Now try saving a piece of text in a variable, and then tweeting the whatever you saved in the variable. 
# 
# To do this, where the code has `client.create_tweet(text="This is the tweet text")`, you'll replace the quoted text with the variable name, so it will look like `client.create_tweet(text=variable_name)` (with whatever your variable name was instead of "variable_name")

# In[18]:


# TODO: enter your code here


# ### Post multiple tweets
# Next try posting 5 tweets, but use `sleep` to add pauses between each one (if you make the pauses over 60 seconds, then the official "time" of the tweet should look different on the twitter interface).
