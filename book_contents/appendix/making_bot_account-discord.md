# Making a Bot Account (Discord)

In using this textbook, you will have opportunities to create and run social media bots. Here we will run through how to create a Discord account and set it up for running your own bots.

While we have made a fake version of Discord for you to test all the code in this book, we highly encourage you to make a Discord bot account and try it out for real!

## Sign up for Discord
[https://discord.com/register](https://discord.com/register)

We suggest making a new, separate Discord account, just for making Discord bots, since you don't want to accidentally get your main Discord account banned or labeled as a bot.

Note: If you want to make a new account and you already have one, you may need to sign out from your current account, use a different email address, or use a different web browser (e.g., Mozilla, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari).

## Create your own Discord Server
It is easiest to test your bot by creating your own discord server.

```


## Create a Discord "Application"

In order for your bot to run, you must create a Discord "Application." Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/) and click "New Application":

name: discord_new_app_button_fig
alt: "Screenshot of the discord developer panel, with the \"application\" tab open, and the \"New Application\" button circled."

```

Make up a name for your app and press the "Create" button:

name: discord_create_app_fig
width: 300px
alt: "Screenshot of the discord create app dialog, with the name for the app being \"soc_media_bot_teaching_demo\""

```
