# Reflection Activities: Compare Social Media Designs


## Compare social media designs
Choose two social media sites ([here is a big list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_services)) and look at their interfaces:
- List the information and actions that are immediately available on equivalent views on each site (e.g., their feed, or a view of a post, or a view of a user profile)
- Why do you think each of these sites choose to emphasize, hide, or even disallow?
- How do you think these decisions change how people behave on these sites?


- list actions that are immediately available (one tap or click or something)
- list actions that are one step removed (two taps)
- list actions that are three steps removed


possibly Following what you did in the data chapter, design a social media platform interface, but this time focus on what actions are available
