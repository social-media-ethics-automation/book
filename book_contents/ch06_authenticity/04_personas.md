# Personas, Code Switching, Context Collapse

The way we present ourselves to others around us (our behavior, social role, etc.) is called our public [persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona). We also may change how we behave and speak depending on the situation or who we are around, which is called [code switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching).

While modified behaviors to present a persona or code switch may at first look inauthentic, they can be a way of authentically expressing ourselves in each particular setting. For example:
- Speaking in a formal manner when giving a presentation or answering questions in a court room may be a way of authentically sharing your experiences and emotions, but tailored to the setting
- Sharing those same experiences and emotions with a close friend may look very different, but still can be authentic
- Different communities have different expectations and meanings around behavior and presentation, so what is appropriate authentic behavior depends on what group you are from and what group you are interacting with (Like in [this Key and Peele comedy sketch](https://www.youtube.com/embed/nopWOC4SRm4), where Jordan Peele is playing President Obama at a meet and greet, and greets the white attendees and Black attendees in very different ways):

Still, these modifications of behavior can also be inauthentic. In the YouTube Video Essay: [YouTube: Manufacturing Authenticity (For Fun and Profit!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FJEtCvb2Kw) by Lindsay Ellis, Ellis explores nuances in authenticity as a YouTuber. She highlights the [emotional labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_labor) of keeping emotional expressions consistent with their public persona, even when they are having different or conflicted feelings. She also highlights how various "calls to action" (e.g., "subscribe to my channel") may be necessary for business and can be (and appear) authentic or inauthentic.

## Context Collapse
Since we have different personas and ways of behaving in different groups of people, what happens if different groups of people are observing you at the same time? For example, someone might not know how to behave if they were at a restaurant with their friends and they noticed that their parents were seated at the table next to them. This is phenomenon is called "[context collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse)."

On social media, context collapse is a common concern, since on a social networking site you might be connected to very different people (family, different groups of friends, co-workers, etc.). Additionally, something that was shared within one context (like a private message), might get reposted in another context (publicly posted elsewhere). 

## Reflection Questions
- How do you notice yourself changing how you express yourself in different situations, particularly on social media?
  - Do you feel like those changes or expression are authentic to who you are, do they compromise your authenticity in some way?
