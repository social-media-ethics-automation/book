# The Experience of Going Viral
While many people on social media post in hopes of getting attention and even going viral, those who have actually had their content go viral often have mixed feelings about it. For example, author Roxane Gay has said, “[Content going viral is overwhelming, intimidating, exciting, and downright scary.](https://psmag.com/economics/going-viral-is-like-doing-cartwheels-on-the-water-spout-of-a-giant-whale).”

The Washington Post wrote a series of articles on the experience of going viral, first [On TikTok, instant fame often comes with a price: Sleepless nights, shadowbans and viral cruelty](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/tiktok-viral-fame-harassment/), and then [Sorry you went viral. TikTok’s explosive stardom has created a new kind of celebrity. But nothing goes viral like rage.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/tiktok-viral-fame-harassment/). Researcher Dr. Casey Fiesler was interviewed for these articles and talks more about it in this TikTok video:

% ## Aside on “Cancel Culture”
% - It seems to me that the term “cancel culture” is used to mean a number of different things.
%  - For offenses ranging from a minor statement that offends some group, to sexual assault of minors (e.g., R. Kelly, Woody Allen, Kevin Spacey)
%  - Facing a range of consequences like:
%    - Celebrity losing  an audience (which may be their livelihood)
%    - Public criticism of a comment or action
%    - Harassment of a person for a comment  or action
%    - Loss of jobs
%    - Rejection of an apology or of a non-apology (e.g., I’m sorry if you were offended)
% - Rather than discuss “cancel culture” as a single thing, we will cover it in pieces:
