# Power Users and Lurkers
When looking at who contributes in crowd work systems, or with social media in generally, we almost always find that we can split the users into a small group of __power users__ who do the majority of the contributions, and a very large group of __lurkers__ who contribute little to nothing. For example, [Nearly All of Wikipedia Is Written By Just 1 Percent of Its Editors](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7x47bb/wikipedia-editors-elite-diversity-foundation), and on StackOverflow “[A 2013 study has found that 75% of users only ask one question, 65% only answer one question, and only 8% of users answer more than 5 questions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow).” We see the same phenomenon on Twitter:
