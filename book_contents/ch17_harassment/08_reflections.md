# Reflections on Harassment

## Activity
Look through a social media feed (e.g., a subreddit, Youtube comments, etc.), and look for examples that you would consider harassment.
- What features of the social media platform that you looked at were used for harassment?
- How were those same features used in non-harassing ways?

## Questions
- How do social media platforms make harassment possible?
- How do you think social media platforms should handle crowd harassment? Are there things they should do to reduce it? Should the consider whether harassment is justified in some instances?
