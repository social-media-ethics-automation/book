# Design Activity: Data and Social media

Look at a social media site:
Identify different pieces of data on the site and answer these questions:
- What is the piece of data you see?
- What data types might be used to represent that data on a computer?
- How is this data a simplification of reality? That is, what does it not capture? Who does it work best for, and who does it not work well for?
- Did the user(s) directly provide that data, or was it collected automatically by the social media site?

Also ask:
- What other data do you think the social media site is collecting that is not being shown?
