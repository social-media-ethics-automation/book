# Disability


A __disability__ is an ability which a person doesn't have, but they were expected to have.[^disability_definitions_footnote] For example:
- If a building only has stair cases to get up to the second floor (it was built assuming everyone could walk up stairs), then someone who cannot walk up stairs has a disability in that situation.
- If a physical picture book was made with the assumption that people would be able to see the pictures, then someone who cannot see has a disability in that situation.
- If tall grocery store shelves that were made with the assumption that people would be able to reach them, then people who are short, or who can't lift their arms up, or who can't stand up, all would have a disability in that situation.
- If an airplane seat that was designed with little leg room assuming people's legs wouldn't be too long, then someone who is very tall, or who has difficulty bending their legs would have a disability in that situation.

[^disability_definitions_footnote]: There are a number of ways to think about disability, such as legal (what legally counts as a disability?), medical (what is a problem to be cured?), etc. We are focused here more on disability as it relates to design and who things in our world are designed for.

Which abilities are expected of people, and therefore what things are considered disabilities, are socially defined. Different societies and groups of people make different assumptions about what people can do, and so what is considered a disability in one group, might just be "normal" in another.

There are many things we might not be able to do that won't be considered disabilities because our social groups don't expect us to be able to do them. For example, none of us have wings that we can fly with, but that is not considered a disability, because our social groups didn't assume we would be able to. Or, for a more practical example, let's look at color vision:

Most humans are trichromats, meaning they can see three base colors (red, green, and blue), along with all combinations of those colors. Human societies often assume that people will be trichromats. So people who can't see as many colors are considered to be [color blind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness), a disability. But there are also a [small number of people who are tetrachromats](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140905-the-women-with-super-human-vision), and can see four base colors (trying to name these base colors in trichromat terms is not straightforward) and all combinations of those colors. In comparison to tetrachromats, trichromats (the majority of people), lack an ability to see some colors. But our society doesn't build things for tetrachromats, so their extra ability to see color doesn't help them much, and trichromats' relative reduction in seeing color doesn't cause them difficulty, so being a trichromat isn't considered to be a disability.

Some disabilities are __visible disabilities__ that other people can notice by observing the disabled person (e.g., wearing glasses is an indication of a visual disability). Other disabilities are __invisible disabilities__ that other people cannot notice by observing the disabled person (e.g., [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360490)). Sometimes people with invisible disabilities get unfairly accused of "faking" or "making up" their disability.

Some people (like many with chronic pain) would welcome a cure that got rid of their disability. Others (like [many autistic people](https://www.autism360.com/news/autism-is-not-a-disability/)), are insulted by the suggestion that there is something wrong with them that needs to be "cured," and think the only reason autism is considered a "disability" at all is because society doesn't make reasonable accommodations for them the way it does for neurotypical people.

Many of the disabilities we mentioned above were __permanent disabilities__, that is, disabilities that won't go away. But disabilities can also be __temporary disabilities__, like a broken leg in a cast, which will eventually get better. Disabilities can even be __situational disabilities__, like the loss of fine motor skills when wearing thick gloves in the cold, or trying to watch a video on your phone in class with the sound off, or trying to type on a computer while holding a baby.

As you look through all these types of disabilities, you might discover ways you have experienced disability in your life. Though please keep in mind that different disabilities can be very diffirent, and everyone's experience with their own disability can vary. So having some experience with disability (such as situation difficulties caused by wearing gloves) does not make someone an expert in any other disabilities.

As for our experience with disability, Kyle has been diagnosed with [generalized anxiety disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803) and Susan has been diagnosed with [depression](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007). Kyle and Susan also both have:
- [near sightedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia): our eyes cannot focus on things far away
- [ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMWtGozn5jU): we have difficulty controlling our focus, sometimes being hyperfocused and sometimes being highly distracted, and also have difficulties with [executive dysfunction](https://youtu.be/H4YIHrEu-TU).
