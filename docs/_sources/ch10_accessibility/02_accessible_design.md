# Accessible Design

There are a number of ways of managing disabilities. All of these ways of managing disabilities might be appropriate at different times for different situations.

## Coping Strategies

Those with disabilities often find ways to cope with their disability, that is, find ways to work around difficulties they encounter and seek out places and strategies that work for them (whether realizing they have a disability or not). For example, kids who is near sighted and don't realize their ability to see is different from others will seek out seats at the front of classrooms where they can see better. As for us two authors, we both have ADHD and were drawn to PhD programs where our ability to hyperfocus on following our curiosity was rewarded (though executive dysfunction with finishing projects created challenges).

This way of managing disabilities puts the burden fully on disabled people to manage their disability, and try to fit in with "normal" people.

## Modifying the Person
Another way for managing disabilities is __[assistive technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology)__, which is something that helps a disabled person act as though they were not disabled. In other words, it is something that helps a disabled person become more "normal" (according to whatever a society's assumptions are). For example:
- Glasses help people with near-sightedness see in the same way that people with "normal" vision do
- Walkers and wheelchairs can help some disabled people move around closer to the way "normal" people can (though stairs can still be a problem)
- A [spoon might automatically balance itself](https://www.liftware.com/) when held by someone whose hands shake
- Stimulants (e.g., caffeine, Adderall) can increase executive function in people with ADHD, so they can plan and complete tasks more like how neurotypical people do.

This way of managing disability gives tools to disabled people to help them become more "normal." So there is a reduced burden on disabled people, but still an expectation that disabled people must become more "normal."

## Making an environment work for all
Another strategy for managing disability is to use __[Universal Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design)__, which originated in architecture. In universal design, the goal is to make environments and buildings have options so that as many people as possible can use it. For example, a building with stairs might also have ramps and elevators, so people with different mobility needs (e.g., people with wheelchairs, baby strollers, or luggage) can access each area. In the elevators the buttons might be at a height that both short and tall people can reach. The elevator buttons might have labels both drawn (for people who can see them) and in braille (for people who cannot), and the ground floor button may be marked with a star, so that even those who cannot read can at least choose the ground floor.

In this way of managing disabilities, the burden is put on the designers to make sure the environment works for everyone, though disabled people might need to go out of their way to access it.

## Making a tool adapt to users
When creating computer programs, programmers can do things that aren't possible with architecture (where Universal Design came out of), that is: programs can change how they work for each individual user. All people (including disabled people) have different abilities, and making a system that can modify how it runs to match the abilities a user has is called __[Ability based design](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1952383.1952384)__. For example, a phone might detect that the user has gone from a dark to a light environment, and might automatically change the phone brightness or color scheme to be easier to read. Or a computer program might detect that a user's hands tremble when they are trying to select something on the screen, and the computer might change the text size, or try to guess the intended selection.

In this way of managing disabilities, the burden is put on the computer programs to detect and adapt to the disabled person (and thus the designers and programmers are responsible for making a program that will do that).
