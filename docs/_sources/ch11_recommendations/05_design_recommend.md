# Design Activity
Come up with at least two different theoretical sets of rules (recommendation algorithms) for what would make a “good” tweet to recommend.
  - Consider all the information you could get about a Tweet, both from the Twitter API, but also information Twitter has internally. For example
    - Tweet engagement
    - Information about the user
    - Information about the topic (that we can try to guess)
    - Other data mining strategies (like Sentiment Analysis)
  - Compare your two different strategies, and think about how users might try to behave in order to game the algorithm
