# Course Schedule

## Homework placements
The programming assignments are dependent on prior chapter material as follows:

- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a1_make_7_reddit_posts.ipynb) depends on Chapter 3 [](../../ch03_bots/00_bots.md)
- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a2_another_site.md) is basically a repeat of A1
- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a3_troll_reply_bot.ipynb) depends on Chapter 7 [](../../ch07_trolling/00_trolling.md)
- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a4-political-bias.ipynb) depends on Ch 8 [](../../ch08_data_mining/00_data_mining.md)
- [](03_course_work/03_assignments/a5-best-comments.ipynb) depends on Ch 14 [](../../ch14_moderation/00_moderation.md)



## Combining Chapters

Depending on your specific schedule, you may need to double up some chapters in lectures. Some good candidate topics for doubling up are:

- Ch 1 Intro / Ch 2 Definitions
- Ch 6 Authenticity / Ch 7 Trolling
- Ch 14 Content Moderation / Ch 15 Content Moderators
- Ch 19 Capitalism / Ch 20 Colonialism

## (Incomplete) Necessary and Skippable Programming Demos
TODO: Some of the programming demos are necessary for understanding future content, and some are not
