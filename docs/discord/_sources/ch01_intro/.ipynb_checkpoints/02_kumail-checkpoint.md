Kumail Nanjiani (a star of the Silicon Valley TV Show), posted on twitter (@kumailn) November 1, 2017:

> As a cast member on a show about tech, our job entails visiting tech companies/conferences etc. We meet ppl eager to show off new tech.
>
> Often we'll see tech that is scary. I don't mean weapons etc. I mean altering video, tech that violates privacy, stuff w obv ethical issues.
>
> And we'll bring up our concerns to them. We are realizing that ZERO consideration seems to be given to the ethical implications of tech.
>
> They don't even have a pat rehearsed answer. They are shocked at being asked. Which means nobody is asking those questions.
>
> "We're not making it for that reason but the way ppl choose to use it isn't our fault. Safeguard will develop." But tech is moving so fast.
>
> That there is no way humanity or laws can keep up. We don't even know how to deal with open death threats online.
>
> Only "Can we do this?" Never "should we do this? We've seen that same blasÃ© attitude in how Twitter or Facebook deal w abuse/fake news.
>
> You can't put this stuff back in the box. Once it's out there, it's out there. And there are no guardians. It's terrifying. The end.
