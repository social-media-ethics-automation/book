# Bots

## Homework due (put in appendix?)
- Create a new twitter account to write bots for (see instructions)
- Pick a framework from the ethics section (or one I missed) and write a paragraph  on it.
- Read the following articles and write a paragraph reflection on what you read:
  - How to Make a Bot That Isn't Racist https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mg7g3y/how-to-make-a-not-racist-bot
  - Ethical Tech Starts With Addressing Ethical Debt https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ethical-tech-starts-with-addressing-ethical-debt/
  - (optional, just for fun) Parody video: https://twitter.com/RachelWenitsky/status/1308479842573332480


## Examples of Bots (or apps)

### Friendly, helpful
- Auto caption: https://twitter.com/headlinerclip
- Vaccine progress: https://twitter.com/vax_progress
- Blocking groups of people: https://twitter.com/blockpartyapp_
- Schedule posts (now built-in to twitter)
- Delete old tweets: https://tweetdelete.net/
- Technical support bots

### Malicious/deceptive bots:
- Spam / harass
  - Not social media, but here is an interesting one: [spamming Kellog’s job application site](https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktoker-wrote-code-spam-kellogg-strike-busting-job-ad-site-2021-12) in support of striking workers:
- Buy “fake” followers: https://www.socialwick.com/tiktok/followers
- Astro-turfing
- [Star Wars Last Jedi Backlash](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/star-wars-last-jedi-backlash-study-russian-trolls-rian-johnson-1202008645/):
  - https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3962091545 (start at 7:49)
  - Bay found that 50.9% of people tweeting negatively about “The Last Jedi” were “politically motivated or not even human,” with a number of these users appearing to be Russian trolls.

### Corrupted bots
- E.g., Microsoft Tay

## Discussion questions
- How are people’s expectations different for a bot and a “normal” user?
- How do you think about identity and responsibility with a bot’s actions?
- How do platforms enable bots to function?
- Why do platforms allow bots to operate?
   - (from a perspective of what their users want, and from a perspective of making profit)

## Programming concepts
- Basic control flow of a computer program
  - Sequenced order of actions
  - Can be repeated with for loops (idea, not details)
  - One action can be to run another program (library/function call)
  - One action is pause (library)
  - variables save work or value to use later
