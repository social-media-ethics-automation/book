# Ethics Frameworks

Oversimplified summaries of a selection of some (but far from all) ethics frameworks:

## Ancient Ethics (mostly about qualities of a good person)

- Confucianism (Confucius ~500, Mencius ~350, Xunzi ~300 BCE, China) (another link)
  - Being and becoming an exemplary person (e.g., respectful, sincere, generous) through ceremonies/rituals.

- Taoism (Lao Tzu ~500, Zhuangzi ~300 BCE China)
  - Act with unforced actions in harmony with the natural cycles of the universe. Trying to force something to happen will likely backfire.
  - Rejects Confucian focus on ceremonies/rituals. Prefers spontaneity and play.

- Virtue Ethics (Aristotle, 300s BCE Greece; Martha Nussbaum, present USA)
  - Acting in ways consistent with the virtues (e.g., courage, truthfulness, wittiness, friendliness, etc.) leads to flourishing of an individual.

- Aztec Virtue Ethics (1300s - 1500s CE in what is now Mexico) (another link)
  - Live a rooted, balanced life of moderation. 
  - Virtue is a group effort. Individuals can’t be virtuous on their own because “the earth is slippery, slick.”


## 1600s - 1700s European Ethics (actions and outcomes)
- Natural Rights (John Locke, 1600s England; Thomas Jefferson 1700s USA)
  - Locke: Everyone has a right to life, liberty, and property
  - Jefferson: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
  
- Consequentialism (Jeremy Bentham 1700’s, John Stuart Mill, 1800’s England): 
  - Actions are judged on the sum total of their consequences (utility calculus)
  - Utilitarianism: "It is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong."

- Deontology (Immanuel Kant, 1700’s Germany, Christine Korsgaard present USA)
  - There are absolute moral rules and duties to follow (regardless of the consequences). They can be deduced by reasoning about the objective reality.
  - Kantianism: “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.” 


## Relational Ethics (maintaining proper relationships)
- Ethics of Care (Carol Gilligan, Nel Noddings, etc., present USA) (another link)
  - Focuses on responsibilities and relational issues in the relationships you are invested in. 
  - Balancing your needs and the needs of those you care for, and sometimes strangers too.
  - Rejects frameworks that focus on scenarios of competing for resources (justice, fairness).

- Ubuntu (Traditional Sub-Saharan Africa; Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu 1990s SA) (another link)
  - “A person is a person through other people.”
  - “Actions are right roughly insofar as they are a matter of living harmoniously with others or honouring communal relationships.” (source) (alternate interpretation)
  - (More on African Ethics here)

- American Indian Ethics (Anne Waters,  VF Cordova, etc., present USA)
  - Distrust of abstract propositional claims, focus on experiential / lived knowledge.
  - Anti-hierarchy. No one should be fully dependent or independent.
  - Learn to perceive the needs of others in order to help the group and maintain equality.
  - Equality for people, but also air, water, plants, etc. (everything is part of one process).
  - (Based on book American Indian Thought. You can also search google scholar)

## Alternative Ethics (various)

- Divine Command Theory
  - Something is right or wrong because God(s) said so.
  - Euthyphro Dilemma: “Is the pious [action] loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?” (Socrates, 400s BCE Greece)
  
- Egoism (Ayn Rand, 1900s America)
  - “Rational Selfishness”: It is rational to seek your own self-interest above all else. Great feats of engineering happen when brilliant people ruthlessly follow their ambition.

- Existentialism (Søren Kierkegaard, 1800s Denmark; Jean-Paul Sartre, 1900s France)
  - Your actions have consequences, but the consequences are unknowable. Even though you desire to do what’s right, there is no objective morality to follow (part of existential angst). You are forced to invent some sort of morality to follow.

- Nihilism
  - There is no right or wrong. Nothing matters.
