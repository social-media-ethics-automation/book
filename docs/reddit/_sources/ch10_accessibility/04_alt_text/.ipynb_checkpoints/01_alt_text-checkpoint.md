# Alt-text

Some users might not be able to see images on websites for a variety of reasons. The user might be blind or low-vision. Their device or internet connection might not support images. Or perhaps all the images got deleted (like [what happened to The Onion](https://www.gawker.com/media/analysis-semafor-reinvents-news-by-making-it-more-confusing-to-read)).

In order for these users to still get the information intended from the images, the image can come with alt-text. You can read more about alt-text in [this New York Times feature](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/18/arts/alt-text-images-descriptions.html)

Twitter lets users provide alt-text for images they post, but they aren't required to do so.

What we will do next is search twitter for posts with images and see which ones have alt-text. But before we do that, we need to look at how to access extra information, like image information, using Tweepy.
